## Prerequisites

- PHP >= 5.4
- The PHP cURL extension

## Composer

To install the package via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org), run the following command:

```
composer require automile/automile-php
```

You also need to require Composer's [autoload](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#autoloading):

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

## Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation, you can download the [latest release](https://github.com/Automile/automile-php/releases)
and include the autoload.php file in your code:

```php
require_once('/path/to/automile-php/init.php');
```

## Sign Up

If you don't yet have an account, you can create one right here:
```php
$userModel = AutomileClient::signUp('username@example.com');
echo $userModel->toPHP();
```
The code above creates an Automile account and provides you with the PHP code to configure the component:
```php
\Automile\Sdk\Config::setUsername('username@example.com');
\Automile\Sdk\Config::setPassword('*****');
\Automile\Sdk\Config::setApiClient('*****.automile.com');
\Automile\Sdk\Config::setApiSecret('*****');
```
Remember to save the code and/or the credentials for future usage.

## Quickstart

First, let's initialize the client.

It's recommended to store the authentication token for futher use,
otherwise the client would have to retrieve new token each time upon initialization.

The token must be stored either outside of the document root, or the directory must be protected via configuration files.

PHP should be allowed to read and write into the token storage directory for the client to function properly.

**Note:** Please make sure that the token storage path is not accessible via HTTP. 

```php
// import required classes
use Automile\Sdk\AutomileClient;
use Automile\Sdk\Config;
use Automile\Sdk\Types;
use Automile\Sdk\Models;

// path to the token
define('AUTOMILE_TOKEN', '/path/to/storage/automile-token.json');

// Automile account credentials
// see also [Sign Up](#sign-up) section
Config::setUsername('username@example.com');
Config::setPassword('*****');
Config::setApiClient('*****.automile.com');
Config::setApiSecret('*****');

// initialize the client from saved token
// if the token is missing, a new one will be created using the credentials above
$client = AutomileClient::fromSavedToken(AUTOMILE_TOKEN);

// provide the path to the token storage file in case the new token is created, or old one refreshed
$client->saveToken(AUTOMILE_TOKEN);

// confirm everything's been set up correctly
$isValid = $client->validateToken()
var_dump($isValid);
```

If the `$isValid` variable contains boolean `true`, everything works as a charm!

If something's not right, please report the issue to the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Automile/automile-php/issues),
and we'll get to it as soon as possible. 

**Note:** Automile is currentley accepting username and password authentication for users belonging to private clients you are creating.

    "TripId" => 31826384,
    "TripTags" => ['note 1', 'note 2'],
    "TripType" => Types\TripType::BUSINESS
]));
```

#### Set specific contact / driver for a trip
```php
$client->setDriverOnTrip(31826384, 2);
```

### Contact Methods

All these methods are used to retrieve one or multiple contacts (drivers). Contact is considered
a driver if they are checked-in into a vehicle.

#### Get all contacts/drivers
```php
$contacts = $client->getContacts();
```
#### Get contact details by it's id

    'GeofencePolygon' => $polygon,
    'GeofenceType' => Types\GeofenceType::OUTSIDE
]));
```

![To see the created geofence visit the web or mobile app](https://content.automile.com/sdk/CreateGeofence.png "The created geofence")

#### Edit a geofence

$client->createGeofence(new Models\Geofence([
    'GeofenceId' => 3319,
    'Name' => 'Another name',
    'Description' => 'Outside main offfice',
    'GeofencePolygon' => $polygon,
    'GeofenceType' => Types\GeofenceType::OUTSIDE
]));
```
If you want to associate additional vehicles, check `createVehicleGeofence()` that adds an existing geofence to a vehicle

#### Delete a geofence
```php
$client->deleteGeofence(881);
```

### Notification Methods

All these methods are used to retrieve one or multiple notifications.
You can also create, edit, mute, unmute and delete notifications. Notifications was earlier
called Triggers.

With notifications you can also easily add webhooks, the destination for a notification could be:
* Webhook (HTTP Post)
* Text
* E-mail
* Inbox (in Automile UI)

#### Webhook format
```json
{
    "triggerMessageHistoryId": 0,
    "triggerId": 0,
    "triggerType": 0,
    "vehicleId": 0,
    "messageData1": "",
    "messageData2": ""
}
```

The message data 1 and 2 will contains data relating to the actual used notification type. If you for
example use a notificiation for trip start or trip end the messageData1 will contain the actual trip id.

#### Get all notifications (earlier called triggers)
```php
$notifications = $client->getNotifications();
```

#### Get details for a specific notification (earlier called triggers)
```php
$notificationDetails = $client->getNotificationById(25173);
```

#### Create a notification
```php
$newNotification = $client->createNotification(new Models\Trigger([
    "IMEIConfigId" => 28288, // What is this ?
	// IMEIConfigId is today called DeviceId and is the device identifier 
	// connected to the vehicle, you can get this id from the vehicle (GetVehicleById method)
    "TriggerType" => Types\TriggerType::ACCIDENT,
    "DestinationType" => Types\DestinationType::SMS,
    "DestinationData" => "+14158320378"
]));
```

**Why  using a different identifier for notifications ?** The reasons is that there are two 
objects, the vehicle contains all properties for a vehicle while a device (earlier called IMEIConfig)
is connected to the vehicle. If you move the device to another vehicle the notifications
are still valid.

#### Edit a notification
```php
$client->editNotification(new Models\Trigger([
    "TriggerId" => 190914,
    "IMEIConfigId => 28288, // See note above, this is the DeviceId
    "TriggerType" => Types\TriggerType::ACCIDENT,
    "DestinationType" = Types\DestinationType::SMS,
    "DestinationData" = "+14158320378"
]));
```

#### Mute a notification
```php
$client->muteNotification(190913, 60*60); // mutes for 1 hour
```

#### Unmute a notification
```php
$client->unmuteNotification(190913);
```

#### Delete a notification
```php
$client->deleteNotification(190913);
```

### Notification Message Methods

This is used to get historic messages that have been sent to the destination configured.

#### Get all notifications messages
```php
$notificationMessages = $client->getNotificationMessages();
```

#### Get all notifications messages for a specific notification
```php
$forSpecificNotification = $client->getNotificationMessagesByNotificationId(148638);
```

### Place Methods

With places you can track visits (stops) to locations and carry out certain automation
rules. A place is a position (latitude and longitude) and a radius (given in metric meters).

#### Get all places
```php
$places = $client->getPlaces();
```

#### Get details for a specific place
```php
$placeDetails = $client->getPlaceById(10977);
```

#### Create a place for automation and associate it with the first vehicle
```php
$newPlace = $client->createPlace(new Models\Place([
    "Name" => "My place",
    "Description" => "My home",
    "PositionPoint" => new Models\GeographicPosition([ "Latitude" => 37.445368, "Longitude" => -122.166608 ]),
    "Radius" => 100, //metric meters
	//This will whenever the vehicle starts at this location set it to business
    "TripType" => Types\TripType::BUSINESS,
    "TripTypeTrigger" => Types\TripTypeTriggerType::START,
    "VehicleId" => 33553
]));
```

#### Edit a place
```php
$client->editPlace(new Models\Place([
    "PlaceId" => 11968,
    "Name" => "My place - edited",
    "PositionPoint" => new Models\GeographicPosition([ "Latitude" => 37.445368, "Longitude" => -122.166608 ])
]));
```

#### Delete a place
```php
$client->deletePlace(11968);
```

### Device Methods

Devices are smartphones or/and Automile's smart boxes. Every box is attached to a vehicle.
Notifications are attached to devices while places and geofences are attached to vehicles.

#### Get all devices
```php
$devices = $client->getDevices();
```

#### Get details for a specific device
```php
$deviceDetails = $client->getDeviceById(28288);
```

#### Register a device and associate it to a vehicle
```php
$newDevice = $client->createDevice(new Models\Device([
    "IMEI" => "353466072332998",
    "SerialNumber" => "6070763210",
    "VehicleId" => 33553,
    "IMEIDeviceType" = null // no need if you register a box
]));
```

#### Edit a device
```php
$client->editDevice(new Models\Device([
    "IMEIConfigId" => 28288,
    "VehicleId" => 33553
]));
```
**What do I use this for ?** This method is used to move a device to another vehicle.
Automile still apply automatic creation of vehicles and moving devices when they are 
moved to new vehicles. But in a cases you may want to move the device manually to another
vehicle.

#### Delete a device
```php
$client->deleteDevice(11968);
```

### Fleet Methods

```php
$newFleet = $client->createFleet(new Models\Company([
    "CreateRelationshipToContactId" => 2,
    "Description" => "Some good description for the fleet",
    "RegisteredCompanyName" => "My new fleet"
]));
```

#### Edit a fleet
```php
$client->editFleet(new Models\Company([
{
    "CompanyId" => 3331,
    "Description" => "Test",
    "RegisteredCompanyName" => "Automile Palo Alto Fleet"
});
```

```

#### Getting details about a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) event
```php
$deviceDTCEvent = $client->getDeviceEventDTCById(1138213);
```

### Publish Subscribe Methods

**Note:** Currentley in alpha. 

Publish subscribe mimics a message queuing system that allows you to create subscribers that whenever a message 
is published will repost the message to your endpoint. The publish subscribe framework is more resilient compared
to simpler web hooks (that are available as part of our notifications) and allows for anonymous, basic, bearer
and Salesforce specific authentication. It also allows for configurable retries and also extends to cover 
modification and creation of certain objects.

Publish subscribe guranteee that messages received have been fully processed in Automile's microservice architecture
which means you can assume all properties have been set and calculated. 

All published messages contains two common properties called PublishMessageType and PublishMessageDateTimeUtc.

PublishMessageType will contain information what kind of message you are receiving:
* TripStartMessage = 0,
* TripEndMessage = 1,
* VehicleModified = 2,
* VehicleCreated = 3,
* DriverModified = 4,
* DriverCreated = 5

PublishMessageDateTimeUtc is the date and time (UTC) when the message was published.

#### Get all publish subscribe records
```php
$publishSubscribeRecords = $client->getPublishSubscribe();
```

#### Get details about a specific publish subscribe record
```php
$detailsPublishSubscribeRecord = $client->getPublishSubscribeById(1);
```

#### Create a new subscription with anonymous authentication (several overloads available)
```php
$newSubscription = $client->createPublishSubscribe("http://requestb.in/pwimfapw");
```

#### Edit a subscription (pointing to an endpoint requiring basic authentication)
```php
$newSubscription = $client->createPublishSubscribe("http:/your_basic_auth_endpoint", new Models\PublishSubscribeAuthentication\Basic([
    "Username" => "username",
    "Password" => "password"
]));
```
#### Delete a subscription (will also delete queued messages)
```php
$client->deletePublishSubscribe(1);
```

#### Format for Trip End message
